# Fintech-Internship-Corda
This program simulates a transaction on the Corda platform. Completely text base with multiple scenarios to be explored. Offer a "break" feature to simulate a failed transaction identified by the internal notary. The notary has been replicated using a simple "backup" system which ensures calculations have been carried out correctly.
